# FinalProject

Update 1: My project currently produces a JFrame labled "Keegan's Game" with a JPanel attached to it. I then made sure the sizing was right for what I wanted. Right now I have just finished the game loop using a delta time loop. This ensures that the game should properly run at 60 frames per second without any bugs. I also added a key handler which uses the WASD keys to move the player around. So far the player is just a white box and the background is black but my next step will be to make both a character for my game as well as world tiles. I also have programmed it to display the FPS in the terminal, and the programming in running at a smooth 60 FPS right now. The immediate next step is to create a character, but then I will be working on the world and a camera to follow the characters movements in the world.
